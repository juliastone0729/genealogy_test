## Family History

Family history reports typically don't have images or other media interspersed throughout, and I think the combination of both will add a real excitement to the research. I have spent many hours researching and writing reports and proofs within the realm of family history, though I am no expert and consider myself an amateur.

Family history research has unique problems to tackle. It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with a bunch of missing pieces. As you put the puzzle together you can begin to see what the puzzle was supposed to look like, and sometimes you just see shadows and glimpses. With the information at hand inferences can be made as to relationships of the deceased.

The main issue with family history research comes in with the volatility of records over time and the availability of records digitally. Family history records like censuses or death certificates may have been lost, destroyed, or just be difficult to find and you won't know until you look. The solution most of the time is to spend more time researching. Though, it isn't always the best solution as most research projects have time limits. Knowing the unique idiosyncrasies of the varying geographic locations helps alleviate wasting time. There are plenty of resources online for guidance, but it's time consuming. At some point the project end needs to be called. This project included everything noted above in some form or another. Writing the report just takes a little more time and thought.

My hope is to provide better understanding to the CollectionBuilder team and future users how the tools will benefit those involved in family history.
