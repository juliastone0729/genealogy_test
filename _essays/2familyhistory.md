## Family History

I've had an appreciation for the difficulties and joys of family history research since I began to explore it myself a handful of years ago. In some ways it's like solving a murder mystery 100 years in the making. I've felt that standard family history reports seem dry and there has to be a way in which to liven them up a bit. I think CollectionBuilder fills that void by the ability to link images and documents directly to the report, as well as providing a means by which a client can see how all the documents relate to one another.

I should say I have spent many hours researching and writing reports and proofs within the realm of family history, though I am no expert and consider myself an amateur.

Family history research has unique problems to tackle. It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with a bunch of missing pieces. As you put the puzzle together sometimes you begin to see what the puzzle was supposed to look like, and sometimes you just see shadows and glimpses. With the information at hand, inferences can be made as to relationships of the deceased.

A few of the main issues with family history research are the volatility of record storage over time and the availability of records digitally. Family history records like censuses or death certificates may have been lost, destroyed, or just be difficult to find and you won't know until you look. The solution most of the time is to spend more time researching. Though, it isn't always the best solution as most research projects have time limits. Knowing the unique idiosyncrasies of the varying geographic locations helps alleviate wasting time. There are plenty of resources online for guidance, but it's time consuming. At some point the project end needs to be called. This project included everything noted above in some form or another.

Another barrier is availability of records digitally. Modern vital records in the United States, like birth and death certificates, are often kept at the state level and require a fee to access them. A few dollars here and there is not a major barrier for some but begins to add up quickly with larger projects. Some vital records were unavailable for this project because of cost and time constraints. 

All that said, my hope is to provide better understanding to the CollectionBuilder team and future users how the tools will benefit those involved in family history.
