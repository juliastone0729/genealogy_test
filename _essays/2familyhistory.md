I put my **thoughts** on family history here. And I add here and save while server is running.



The main issue with family history research comes in with the volatility of records over time and the availability of records digitally. Family history records like censuses or death certificates may have been lost or destroyed and you won't know until you look. The solution most of the time is to spend more time researching. Though, it isn't always the best solution as most research projects have time limits. Knowing the unique idiosyncrasies of the varying geographic locations helps alleviate wasting time. There are plenty of resources online for guidance, but it's time consuming. At some point the project end needs to be called. This project included everything noted above in some form or another. Writing the report just takes more time and thought.
