Time is a limiter
A note on the research.

More difficult items to find that took many hours of manual search.


Probate records can possibly exist, but I was not able to find them within the scope of Clarence Knuckles or the limited scope of this project.


Otherwise here are interesting documents that help fill out previous research




1950 Federal Census


Elizabeth Knuckles Death Certificate


For future research

The family of Clarence and Isiah stayed in relatively the same place throughout the observed time frame. As such, a more thorough look at the local probate records may provide some insight into their deaths and property distribution that occurred in the family.  

The cemeteries where the families are buried provide a hint of religious affiliation. There's a chance that some church records still exist. The Church that Isiah and Lizzie attended and were buried next to, the Mulberry church, ceased to function in the 1940s, so a search for those may prove difficult.

Samuel Knuckles is likely Isaiah Knuckles father. Finding a document linking them would help to establish family ties and further research avenues. Additionally there are brief reports online about Samuel Knuckles that could provide more insight into their family history.
