## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to find as much information as possible about Clarence Knuckles and his wife Odessa Smith through a search of census and vital records. The same work was also done in researching Clarence Knuckles' parents, Iziea (sounds like Isaiah) Knuckles and Elizabeth Hardy. 

## Summary of Findings

Most of the relevant censuses were found for Clarence, Odessa, Iziea, and Elizabeth. The 1930 and 1940 census records help prove a marriage between Clarence and Odessa, even though a marriage record was not initially found.[(1)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/9sources.html)

In the case of Iziea and Elizabeth, their appearance together in the 1900, 1910, and 1920 census help to prove their marriage.[(2)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/9sources.html) Note in the 1900 census shown below that Iziea and Lizzie Knuckles are noted as being married. In the succeeding census data one can tell they stay together as the same family unit.

The death certificate of Clarence help to piece together family information and help prove marriage relationships as well.[(3)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/9sources.html) An index that pointed to Elizabeth Knuckles', Clarence's mother, death certificate was found, but further searching will need to take place to find the document.

The presumed gravestone of Iziea has "Rev." before his name which suggests that he was a reverend of the Mulberry church in which cemetery he was buried.[(4)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html)

Further research into the history of the cemetery revealed that a prominent member of the society Samuel Knuckles, one of the first African American representatives in the South, was also buried there. He had served in the South Carolina House of Representatives during Reconstruction.[(5)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/9sources.html) An Iziea appears in the 1870 census along with his father named Samuel.[(6)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/9sources.html) It is likely that Iziea was the son of Samuel and their ties to the church caused Iziea to become a reverend there.
