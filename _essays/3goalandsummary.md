## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to find as much information as possible about Clarence Knuckles and Odessa Smith through a search of census and vital records. The same work was also done in researching Clarence Knuckles' parents, Isiah Knuckles and Elizabeth Hardy. 

## Summary of Findings

Most of the Relevant Censuses were found for Clarence, Odessa, Isiah, and Elizabeth. The 1930 and 1940 census records help prove a marriage between Clarence and Odessa, even though a marriage record was not found.[(1)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html)

In the case of Isiah and Elizabeth, their appearance together in the 1900, 1910, and 1920 census help to prove their marriage.[(2)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html)

Death Certificates of Clarence and Elizabeth help to piece together family information and help prove their marriages as well.[(3)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html)

The presumed gravestone of Isiah has "Rev." before his name which suggests that he was a reverend, most likely a reverend of the Mulberry church in whose cemetery he was buried.[(4)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html) Further research into the history of the cemetery revealed that a prominent member of the society, Samuel Knuckles, one of the first African American representatives, in the south, was also buried there. He had served in the South Carolina House of Representatives during Reconstruction.[(5)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html) An Isiah appears in the 1870 census along with his father named Samuel.[(6)](https://zigavivei.github.io/family_history_cb/sources.html) It could be that Isiah was the son of Samuel and their ties to the church caused Isiah to become a reverend there. 













This decision helped immensely. Not only was I able to focus my research, but I was also able to provide CDIL with a more concrete outline of the website--primarily the interactive map.

From here, I compiled sources for each of Idaho's seven regions--regions based on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG)'s hunting regions (Panhandle, Clearwater, Southwest, Magic Valley, Southeast, Upper Snake, Salmon), because those are what determine hunting and trapping seasons, number of tags, and other interactions with wildlife presence.

After redrawing the base and mapping out regions and locations (for both Idaho and Montana, just in case I would integrate Montana sources), I decided to use the Senate Bill 1211 as the base of Idaho, since the policy affects the entire state. I wanted the words to literally shape the landscape, so I cut each sentence and glued them down in a spiral pattern, working from the top of the state down and into the middle.

As I did this, I had an additional copy of the bill for reference, highlighting each line that I glued down to make sure nothing got mixed up. After a very lengthy process, the final challenge was fitting the last page of the bill--I ended up using the passage bellow as Idaho's border, because it contained the most potent and relevant information to wolf management:

> *Livestock and domestic animal owners may take all nonlethal steps they deem necessary to protect their property. ...Wolves  may be disposed of by any federal agency, state agency, private contractor, political subdivision of the state of Idaho, or agency of another state when the population has exceeded the recovery goals of the Idaho wolf conservation and management plan in an effort to maintain a balance of all wildlife populations.*
> 
> -- 2021 Legislation: Senate Bill 1211
{:.blockquote}

This passage became a defining border, a line which, if crossed, determines a wolf's fate. After some experimentation with printing on yellow paper, I cut out and glued those colored sentences around the border.
