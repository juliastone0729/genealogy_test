## Abstract

CollectionBuilder is "an open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology"[(0)](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) developed by the University of Idaho. This project aimed to test the feasibility and framework of CollectionBuider within the scope of presenting family history research and reports. Acting as a new user, the project helped refine documentation and tutorials. The outcome of this project is a family history research report, the first family history report developed within the CollectionBuilder framework, as well as a review of my experience and efficacy of CollectionBuilder in presenting family history work.

## CollectionBuilder

I'm interested in using CollectionBuilder because of the way it can seamlessly blend text, images, video, and other files together. 

Before this project, I was not well versed in CollectionBuilder, I only had completed one project with CollectionBuilder up to this point and knew very little. The previous project implemented a more user-friendly version of the framework that didn't require much work to bring online. My lack of knowledge is beneficial for this project as I'll be making an analysis of the tutorials and walkthroughs that they have developed for their new users. In helping the team develop their literature, I will also develop my understanding of the way the system is used, which will enable me to create a better proof of concept when it comes to creating a family history report using their system.  

CollectionBuilder is built to be an easier system than most, but the version that allows the most customization requires some knowledge of HTML and Markdown language to understand. I don't understand HTML coding or Markdown, so I've had to learn some basic HTML and markdown language to be able to encode my project. My struggles haven't been all in vain; I have been learning, albeit a bit painfully some days. My supervisor has been kind enough to walk me through some hands-on tutorials and otherwise has been available to answer questions I have as they have come up. This was useful to me because I didn't know enough at the time to have the knowledge to know what some of the customization processes even looked like.

This site will not only be the first of its kind within the CollectionBuilder space, but also a proof of concept to the breadth of uses CollectionBuilder has.
