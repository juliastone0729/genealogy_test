Abstract
CollectionBuilder is "an open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology" developed by the University of Idaho. This project aimed to test the feasibility and framework of CollectionBuider within the scope of presenting family history research and reports. Acting as a new user, the project helped refine documentation, walkthroughs, and tutorials. The outcome of this project is a family history research report, the first family history report developed within CollectionBuilder, as well as a review of my experience and efficacy of CollectionBuilder in presenting family history work.


My capstone project combines the joys of Family History and the power of CollectionBuilder, an online based collection system developed by the University of Idaho to display digitized collections. Using new genealogical research, I will create a report that uses the ease of CollectionBuilder to create a multi-model essay. This site will not only be the first of its kind within the CollectionBuilder space, but also a proof of concept to the breadth of uses CollectionBuilder has. Additionally, I will help the CollectionBuilder team bolster their tutorials and walkthroughs by analyzing their ease of use to myself as a user. 

 

I have spent hundreds of hours researching and writing reports and proofs within the realm of family history. I have only completed one project with CollectionBuilder and know very little. This will be extremely beneficial to my analysis of the tutorials and walkthroughs that they have developed for their new users. In helping the team develop their literature, I will also develop my understanding of the way the system is used, which will enable me to create a better proof of concept when it comes to creating a family history report using their system.  

 

During the course of the project, I will provide edits and additions to the written guides available for CollectionBuilder. Additionally I will create a genealogical report produced from new family history research with a website built using CollectionBuilder in tandem to the genealogical report, as a multi-model essay. Finally, I will write an analysis of the project, taken from the journal entries and final project, denoting the ups and downs of using CollectionBuilder to enhance genealogical work, as well as a report detailing my experience of CollectionBuilder as a capstone project. My hope is to provide better understanding to the CollectionBuilder team and future users how the tools will benefit those involved in family history as well as streamline new user experiences. 


I think the most surprising aspect of my project was learning how deep and versatile CollectionBuilder is. The same software that can build a robust, easy-to-use, digital collection site is also quite deep. I don't completely understand the coding involved and how everything fits together, but I've been able to learn at least some of what is relevant within the scope of my project and collection. Though I've been told it is easy for first time users and malleable for veteran users, its been fun to learn it first hand. 

My supervisor was very kind and gave me a roughly 2 hour long tutorial on some of the intricacies for the more complex facets of CollectionBuilder customization. This was useful to me because I didn't know enough at the time to have the knowledge to know what some of the customization processes even looked like. 

My project is mainly managed through GitHub, which has a mountain of a learning curve. Though I have minimal coding experience, this project has given me insight into coding, particularly the Ruby language. I've also never used slack before, but it has been invaluable as a forum for asking questions to the general CollecitonBuilder userbase and team.

I think the major thing I've learned thus far in this project is to not be afraid to ask for help. Lots of people know a whole lot more than me, so i can struggle in silence or ask someone and progress. 

CollectionBuilder is built to be an easier system than most, but the version that allows the most customization requires some knowledge of HTML and Markdown language to understand. I don't understand HTML coding or Markdown, so I've had to learn some basic HTML and markdown language to be able to encode my project. This is the part that I am working through right now. My struggles haven't been all in vain; I have been learning, albeit a bit painfully some days. My supervisor has been kind enough to walk me through some hands-on tutorials and otherwise has been available to answer questions I have as they have come up. Without her help, I would not be progressing right now. 

Going forward, there will be more work done in completing my collections website. I imagine most of my problems will be during this portion, troubleshooting the layout and formatting of the site as I continue to learn how this all fits together. 


Wolf... a word that carries a lot of weight, especially in the state of Idaho. Opinions range from a supportive yearning for wilderness to a fervent desire to secure safe, usable land. While both proponents and opponents of wolves hold valid concerns about reintroduction, their conflicting discourses have turned the wolf into a controversial, polarizing figure. How did it come to this? How do we navigate the current discourses surrounding wolves? And how do wolves, in turn, navigate the landscape shaped by our discourses? My hope is that this project can act as a catalyst for conversation, one that allows viewers to see the various dimensions surrounding the topic of wolf reintroduction in Idaho.

So why create a multimodal project? First and foremost, multimodality is the combination of visual, aural, written and kinesthetic modes of communication, used together to effectively explore and explain ideas. In the case of ecological art, this powerful combination can help to educate people about complex environmental issues. 

We perceive the world through many simultaneous senses, which multimodality helps us express and explore. In the case of multimodality, Alex Weik von Mossner reflects upon the effectiveness of film: "The multimodal relationships between people, objects, landscapes, and our embodied brains are particularly complex in the case of film, which not only provides narrative (like literature) or visual information (like a painting) but also sound and, most importantly, motion" (53). For an excellent example of film's effective multimodality, I have included the animation "Wolves and Trophic Cascades" (2023), made by Kieran Hughes.

Rather than explain trophic cascade through a lengthy research paper, Hughes has schematized the relationship of wolves to their ecosystems in a simple yet striking visualization, translating a complex scientific topic to wider audiences. Similar to the multiple modes used in movies and animations, a multimodal project--and ecological art for that matter--should also provide numerous channels for understanding and connecting information. 

With these objectives in mind, I wanted to create a multimodal project that people will see outside of an academic sphere. Rather than pushing viewers further into their current points of view, I aim to foster more conversation, investigation and overall understanding of wolf reintroduction in Idaho.
