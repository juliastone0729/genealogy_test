This kind of work doesn't happen without help. I'm thankful for my wife who took care of me during the most difficult times of this project. I couldn't have done this without my parents who introduced me to family history work at a young age. In addition, My brother-in-law gave me the breadcrumbs necessary to begin researching his ancestry.

This project would not be possible without the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning at the University of Idaho Library's digital humanities and digital scholarship center, the CollectionBuilder team, and the CollectionBuilder framework that they have built.

I'm eternally grateful to Julia Stone, my field supervisor. I would struggle figuring out the ins and outs of CollectionBuilder and Markdown language, and she would swoop in and save the day when I needed it most.
