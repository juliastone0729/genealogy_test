First, I would continue to research the Knuckles family, both ancestry and descendance from Clarence. The family of Clarence and Isiah stayed in relatively the same place throughout the observed time frame. As such, a more thorough look at the local probate records may provide some insight into their deaths and property distribution that occurred in the family. Odds are I'm going to do this anyway as the Knuckles family are ancestors of a family member of mine.

Second, I would like to develop a step-by-step video tutorial series surrounding CollectionBuilder and the methods to incorporate into family history. I would need to sharpen my video-editing skills, but I think video tutorials combining CollectionBuilder and family history will benefit both new and expert genealogists.

Thirdly, and tied to the second goal, I would want to develop my skills within CollectionBuilder to build a more streamlined framework for family history specifically. Within this project we worked to make a more viable essay format, but something that more closely resembles the formats of family history reports, while using modern web technology presented by CollectionBuilder, would be better.

Lastly, I would want to work with collaborators. I think I was limited by my own ability, strengths, and knowledge in a handful of areas for this project and working with others would help spread the work and help brainstorm through problems.

Visually-speaking, there were so many better options to include in Montana's space. Something had to be done, and it wasn't going to be easy. Trying to peel or cut off the timeline proved fruitless. Ultimately, I decided to sand it off.

After an hour or so of playing heavy metal and aggressively sanding (no video taken of this effort, unfortunately...), I exorcized the timeline from the piece and used deep green acrylic paint to cover the background. Once the paint dried, I added the title on cardboard and the helicopter, nailing down detective lines to connect it to the release sites. At long last, the collage was complete!

Once this website was created, CDIL and I designed a QR code to be included on the artist's statement, connecting the physical collage to this digital space.

You may be thinking, "Wow, this process was probably a lot harder than writing a paper....Was it worth it?"

Yes. Yes it was. I would go as far to say that this process was as complex and messy as wolf reintroduction itself, and maybe that's the point. This controversy has no easy answers, and it needs a lot of work, collaboration and creativity to solve. Sometimes the right way--at least, the way my passion led me--isn't the easy way. But it's worth it, the journey of growth, creation and experimentation.
