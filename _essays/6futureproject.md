First, I would continue to research the Knuckles family, both ancestry and descendance from Clarence. The family of Clarence and Isiah stayed in relatively the same place throughout the observed time frame. As such, a more thorough look at the local probate records may provide some insight into their deaths and property distribution that occurred in the family. Odds are I'm going to do this anyway as the Knuckles family are ancestors of a family member of mine.

Second, I would like to develop a step-by-step video tutorial series surrounding CollectionBuilder and the methods to incorporate into family history. I would need to sharpen my video-editing skills, but I think video tutorials combining CollectionBuilder and family history will benefit both new and expert genealogists.

Thirdly, and tied to the second goal, I would want to develop my skills within CollectionBuilder to build a more streamlined framework for family history specifically. Within this project we worked to make a more viable essay format, but something that more closely resembles the formats of family history reports, while using modern web technology presented by CollectionBuilder, would be better.

Lastly, I would want to work with collaborators. I think I was limited by my own ability, strengths, and knowledge in a handful of areas for this project and working with others would help spread the work and help brainstorm through problems.
