## Next Steps for the Project

I would like to develop a step-by-step video tutorial series surrounding CollectionBuilder and the best practices to use it for family history. I would need to sharpen my video-editing skills, but I think video tutorials combining CollectionBuilder and family history will benefit both new and expert genealogists.

Tied to the above goal, I would want to develop my skills within CollectionBuilder to build a more streamlined framework for family history specifically. Within this project we worked to make a more viable essay format, but something that more closely resembles the formats of family history reports, while using modern web technology presented by CollectionBuilder, would be better. I imagine more time and experience would round out my ability to express a family history report in this format.

In addition I would want to work with collaborators. I think I was limited by my own ability, strengths, and knowledge in a handful of areas for this project and working with others would help spread out the work and help brainstorm through problems.
