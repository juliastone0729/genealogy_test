## The Project 

This genealogical report was created by Samuel Howard as a capstone project. It aimed to combine his amateur knowledge of family history research with the CollectionBuilder framework to develop a new way to present family history reports.

On this website, you can explore this project's two main components:

1. A [**Report**]({{ '/1whycollectionbuilder.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark} about the genealogical history of the Knuckles family, starting with brief explanations on the reasoning to use CollectionBuilder in combination with family history research.
3. An archived collection of over 10 genealogical sources, which can be found in [**Map**]({{ '/map.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}, [**Timeline**]({{ '/timeline.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}, [**Subjects**]({{ '/subjects.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}, and [**Browse**]({{ '/browse.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}.
