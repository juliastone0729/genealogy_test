## The Project 

This genealogical proof was created by Samuel Howard as a capstone project.

On this website, you can explore this project's two main components:

1. A [**Report**]({{ '/1whycollectionbuilder.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark} about the genealogical history of the Knuckles family.
3. An archived collection of over 20 genealogical sources, which can be found in [**Map**]({{ '/map.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}, [**Timeline**]({{ '/timeline.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}, [**Subjects**]({{ '/subjects.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}, and [**Browse**]({{ '/browse.html' | relative_url }}){:.text-dark}.
